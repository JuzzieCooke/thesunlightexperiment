Using This Code:
The code for thesunlight experiment is listed to be copy and pasted into the code blurb in the website itself. 

In the future, I would like to find a way to have it automatically update into the source code of the website theme. Some of the code, such as for the individual herbs, nootropics, and conditions with thte goal fo adding style... will still need to be copy and pasted. The files that are likely going to be updated frequently, and are present on a wide range of pages should be automaitc. These include the sidebars, and organisation pages. 

Another thing I would love to add is to have cookies to determine whether the herb pages were reached through the botanical name, or the common name because the pages themselves are the same, but the sidebars should be different. f they clicked the botanical organisation and entered a herb pagem the side bar should also list the herbs by botanical name rather than the default common names. 

This could also be achieved through the use of a drop down selector. More research and testing will need to be done on this. 


THIS IS TO TEST TIME TRAVEL
adding updates from branch

I think this might damage something
